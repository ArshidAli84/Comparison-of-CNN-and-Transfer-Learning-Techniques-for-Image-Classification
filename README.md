# Comparison-of-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning-Techniques-for-Image-Classification

The goal of this project is to simply implement and identify photos from the Caltech 101 dataset utilizing transfer learning techniques with pre-trained CNN architectures (VGG16 and InceptionV3). In order to improve model performance, transfer learning entails applying knowledge from a source domain—pre-trained models—to a target domain—our particular dataset. We fine-tune the model for our goal by adding custom dense layers for classification and freezing the convolutional basis of the pre-trained models. This method produces better classification efficiency and accuracy since the trained models include extensive feature learning from large-scale datasets such as ImageNet. The effectiveness of transfer learning in improving image classification tasks is demonstrated by the performance comparison of the CNN, VGG16, and InceptionV3 models, which offers important insights into model selection and architecture for related projects.
